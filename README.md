# Summer-Training-Iris-Dataset

# 🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis Project

This project performs detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **outlier detection** on the classic Iris dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 📌 Features Implemented

- ✅ Data loading and inspection
- ✅ Summary statistics (mean, median, std, variance, etc.)
- ✅ Checking for:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicates
  - Unique values
- ✅ Data visualization:
  - Countplots
  - Boxplots
  - Violin plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Pairplots
  - Correlation heatmap
- ✅ Outlier detection using:
  - IQR method
  - (Upcoming: Z-score method)
- ✅ Outlier removal to clean the dataset

## 📈 Visual Insights

The analysis reveals:
- Distribution patterns across species
- Relationships between sepal and petal measurements
- Presence of outliers, especially in SepalWidth

---

## 🚀 Upcoming Improvements

🔧 **Feature Engineering (coming soon)**:
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Derived feature creation
- Normalization and skewness correction

---

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
